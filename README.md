# Vivacious-Vivariums-Pet-Shop
Pet shop program that allows you to donate pets and adopt them. 

I chose to create a friendly pet shop where a user can adopt or donate pets to the registry of the pet shop. 
This is done by naming the pet in donation and adopting the pet by the collar number created at the beginning of the process. 
The program uses an abstract animal class that incorporates dogs, cats, reptiles, and fish as an extension of the animal class. 
The interface is used as a customer service front end menu that allows for pets to be added or subtracted through adoption and donation. 
The menu also allows the user to sort the pets in the shop, count the amount of current unadopted animals, and read and write files to the program itself. 
In strategy I used the bank from PA09 to ease the amount of code necessary to create the program. Keeping it organized based on what I learned from that assignment 
and the ones leading up to it. I chose a pet shop that does not rely on monetary value as it would become a replica of the bank itself and in design, I removed this scope. 
In testing the program all animals were able to be implemented and the program works as desired and illustrated by the features required by the assignment.
